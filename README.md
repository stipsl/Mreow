I don't trust people.

If I'm ignoring you or being dry it simply means I don't like you.

I'm romanian so my english isn't the best ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”

Pony Town stuff :

Please DNI if you're in any way associated with Hexl, I don't want to talk to people who support their disgusting actions. They've been sending death threats to minors and I consider that a really disgusting act. I, MYSELF make jokes like that but not around strangers or people I don't feel close to (basically people who know my humour). That's just immature. They're friends with someone named Randy on there btw, DNI if you're associated with that person too.

I'm mostly on PT, I only get on custom servers when I'm bored or playing with my partner

I don't really interact with fandoms because of how disgusting some have gotten, and because I've had a lot of bad experiences with people that are in them.

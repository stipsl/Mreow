I don't trust people.

If I'm ignoring you or being dry it simply means I don't like you.

My world <3 : @GothicCowboy [8/07/2021]

I'm mostly on PT, I only get on custom servers when I'm bored or playing with my partner

I don't really interact with fandoms because of how disgusting some have gotten, and because I've had a lot of bad experiences with people that are in them. 

I'm romanian so my english isn't the best ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
